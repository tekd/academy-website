    <div class="row">
      <div class="column large-12">
        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">What is an Academy Coaching Program?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">It is a hands-on, issue-focused learning and mentoring program designed to help you design and implement solutions to one or another specific type of public interest problem using civic technology. Geared to the purpose-driven participant who is a member of an active team that is passionate about a public problem and already undertaking a project, this program helps you develop a project from idea to implementation. Unlike a traditional accelerator, we focus only on the public interest and only on projects that work with real-world institutions and partners, such as agencies and NGOs, to develop more effective and scalable initiatives.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">How Does it Work?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">The coaching programs are  limited enrollment (maximum class size of 10 projects), entirely online, highly customized, and meet every week for 4 consecutive weeks or every other week for 8 weeks. To help you and your team become more effective, we offer a combination of coaching and skill-building, connection to a network of subject-matter experts, peer to peer mentoring, customized and original learning materials, and frequent and constructive feedback opportunities from a team of teachers and peers at every stage of your agile design-driven process.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Where Do the Sessions Meet?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">Entirely online.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">How Much Time Will This Take?</p>
          <ul class="e-answer">
            <li>Upon admission, faculty and staff will engage with your team to identify opportunities, diagnose problems, and develop a customized reading and research plan.</li>
            <li>Each week, the full group meets online with the faculty for 1-2 hours where one hour is discussion of projects by the group and the second hour is a guest lecture.</li>
            <li>Each week, participants meet on their own in smaller groups.</li>
            <li>Every other week, faculty and staff hold an "office" hour with the team to address project progress.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">Who May Participate?</p>
          <div class="e-answer">
            <p>Innovators working inside, outside, or in collaboration with public institutions. We will give strong preference to team, as opposed to individual, applications -- especially teams based in US cities</p>
            <p>And you have:</p>
            <ul class="b-list">
              <li>A problem about which you are passionate.</li>
              <li>An open mind to developing innovative approaches that take advantage of technology to bring the broader palette of human expertise to bear on your problem.</li>
              <li>Intellectual curiosity and a willingness to experiment are essential for this course. No formal technology training is assumed or required, but a willingness to play with new tools will be.</li>
              <li>Time and energy to commit to the program activities.</li>
              <li>The drive to do what it takes to develop a project from idea to implementation with the potential of real-world impact for people and communities. Keep in mind that the way to have the greatest impact might not involve building an app or creating a new non-profit but collaborating with others.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">How Do I Apply?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">To apply, you must submit a 1-2 page description of the problem you or your team wants to tackle and the metric for success by filling out this application form (should we use the last one?).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">There are Three People in My Office Who Want to Do This. Can Teams Apply?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">Yes, people are encouraged to apply as a team. Each member must complete his or her own skills profile but teams work on a common project throughout the program. People can also choose to become a team and work on a common project during the course of the program.

          <p class="e-question">Who are the Mentors? Can I Pick My Own?</p>
          <div class="e-answer">
            <p>Mentors are either subject matter experts working on similar problems or challenges or people who have a track record as effective change agents. The best mentors, of course, are your classmates.</p> 
            <p>You can find your own but we commit to helping to pair you with relevant domain experts.</p>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">This Looks Like a Lot of Work?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">It is. This is not a simulation but an opportunity to get a real civic tech project closer to implementation. A lot of work will need to get done outside the classroom, including user interviews and background research. Although we take account of the fact that people have other jobs and classes, this is a lot of work but in connection with your passions!</p>
