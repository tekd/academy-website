		<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p>More and more organizations are turning to crowds for help in solving their most vexing innovation and research questions. But managers remain understandably cautious. It seems risky and even unnatural to push problems out to vast groups of strangers distributed around the world, particularly for organizations and institutions built on a history of internal innovation. Understanding what kinds of problems a crowd really can handle better and how to manage the process requires careful design. However, after a decade of study, we have identified when crowds tend to outperform internal organizations (or not). This program is designed to help those wishing to integrate crowdsourcing into ongoing projects. Whether policymaking or service delivery in nature, we start from the assumption that, engaging citizens is generally both more effective and more legitimate as a way of working. Together we will explore how to better harness crowdsourcing and distributed innovation networks by offering guidance on choosing the best form of crowdsourcing for a given situation. Applicants should have a clear view of the problem they are trying to solve and either an ongoing or an about-to-start crowdsourcing project. Although everyone is invited to apply, there will be an admissions preference for those working at the city-level.</p>

Lakhani is the Lumry Family Associate Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School and the Principal Investigator of the Harvard-NASA Tournament Lab at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science. He specializes in the management of technological innovation in firms and communities. His research is on distributed innovation systems and the movement of innovative activity to the edges of organizations and into communities. He has extensively studied the emergence of open source software communities and their unique innovation and product development strategies. He has also investigated how critical knowledge from outside of the organization can be accessed through innovation contests. Currently Professor Lakhani is investigating incentives and behavior in contests and the mechanisms behind scientific team formation through field experiments on the TopCoder platform and the Harvard Medical School. Professor Lakhani’s research on distributed innovation has been published in Harvard Business Review, Innovations, Management Science, Nature Biotechnology, Organization Science, Research Policy and the Sloan Management Review. He is the co-editor of Perspectives on Free and Open Source Software (MIT Press), a book on community-based innovation. He has also published teaching cases on leading organizations practicing distributed innovation including: Data.gov, InnoCentive, Google, Myelin Repair Foundation, SAP, Threadless, TopCoder and Wikipedia. His research has been featured in publications like BusinessWeek, The Boston Globe, The Economist, Fast Company, Inc., The New York Times, The New York Academy of Sciences Magazine, Science, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and Wired. Professor Lakhani was awarded his Ph.D. in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also holds an MS degree in Technology and Policy from MIT, and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Management from McMaster University in Canada. He was a recipient of the Aga Khan Foundation International Scholarship and a four year doctoral fellowship from Canada's Social Science and Humanities Research Council. Prior to coming to HBS he served as a Lecturer in the Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship group at MIT’s Sloan School of Management.
