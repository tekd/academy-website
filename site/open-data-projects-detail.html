		<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p>Open data refers to the growing practice of making government data freely available, easily machine processable and without any restrictions on reuse.  As such, open data can be a democratizing force for organizations that traditionally have less access to mission-critical information such as Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) or Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs). Leveraging open data can enable organizations to make more well-informed decisions. This course is designed for individuals and organizations (including SMEs) eager to develop open data-driven decisions. In particular, the course will seek to: a) develop an understanding of what open data is, how it is produced, where it can be accessed, and who is using it currently. decisions; b) learn from others through understanding how existing organizations are using open data to create solutions, and to optimize their operations, through in-depth case studies and analyses; c) provide strategies for small organization to define the problem they seek to solve, take stock of open data resources available to them, and experiment with open data through trial-and-error; d) understand the challenges and best practices of open data use; and, e) develop tools and strategies to measure the success of open data use, and to assess its impact on your organization.</p>
