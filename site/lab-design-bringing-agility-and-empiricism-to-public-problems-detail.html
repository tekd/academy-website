		<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p>Although there is no one shared definition of what constitutes a social or public lab, the “lab approach” might be expected to include experimentation in a safe space at one remove from everyday reality, with the goal of generating useful ideas that address social needs and demonstrating their effectiveness in practice There are several hundred ‘living labs’, mainly technology based, and enabling some user input to shaping technologies. More recently, labs of various kinds have spread into governments, some using design methods to better understand needs and opportunities, some focused on data, or using challenges to elicit ideas. Aimed at those teams and individuals who are actively starting or running social or public labs, this four week program combines online discussion and skill-building among diverse peers and with expert coaches. The program provides frequent and constructive feedback to help deepen and improve Lab practice.</p>
