			<h3>Passionate about Data Driven Criminal Justice Innovation?</h3>
			<ul class="b-list">
				
					<li>Are you a state or local government official eager to deliver better services and make better policies informed by data?

					<li>Are you a health or mental health organization wanting to combine data with your criminal justice counterparts to identify super-utilizers of both systems?</li>
				
					<li>Are you an advocacy organization that would like to open up access to its collected data for broader research?</li>

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p><p>The Data Driven Criminal Justice Coaching Program has support from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and is run in partnership with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (and its efforts to accelerate more city, county and states willing to adopt voluntary, data-driven approaches to improve public health and safety, and reduce unnecessary incarceration). The program is a first-of-its-kind online convening of those working on empirically-based criminal justice innovation projects, including those working in criminal justice, health, mental health and related agencies as well as researchers and advocates, and who share a common desire to make greater use of data to understand past performance, improve day-to-day operations, and develop innovative approaches to the operations of the criminal justice system.</p> <p>Perhaps you want to combine arrest data with Medicaid hospitalization data to identify the super-utilizers of both systems? Or you are stuck trying to figure out the applicable legal and privacy protections inhibiting the creation of data exchanges? Maybe you want to identify which social service alternatives to incarceration are working, when and for whom, and which are not? Have you developed a new algorithm for determining pre-trial release?</p> <p>Every other week for ten weeks, participants will come together to learn both from one another and from experts in responsible data sharing practices. Participants also receive personalized project management coaching designed to help you overcome the specific barriers to implementation you are facing.</p> <p>This program is offered in response to what we are hearing from you about the demand for more help, expertise and capacity building to enable you to make better use of data both to understand past performance and to improve day-to-day operations of criminal justice in your communities.</p> <p>The program is intended for those with a data driven criminal justice innovation project in mind. It is not a lecture course in data science but a hands-on, customized coaching and mentoring program for up to 12 teams or individuals. The program is designed to help you bring your project from idea to fruition. The program follows the outlines of our public problem solving method but is flexibly configured to be responsive to your specific needs.</p> <p>With implementation as our lodestar, we will focus together on developing the essential aspects of the projects at each stage.</p>

              <h4>Co-Founder and Chief Research and Development Officer</h4>
              <p>Stefaan G. Verhulst is Co-Founder and Chief Research and Development Officer of the Governance Laboratory @NYU (GovLab) where he is responsible for building a research foundation on how to transform governance using advances in science and technology. Verhulst’s latest scholarship centers on how technology can improve people’s lives and the creation of more effective and collaborative forms of governance. Specifically, he is interested in the perils and promise of collaborative technologies and how to harness the unprecedented volume of information to advance the public good. Before joining NYU full time, Verhulst spent more than a decade as Chief of Research for the Markle Foundation, where he continues to serve as Senior Advisor. At Markle, an operational foundation based in New York, he was responsible for overseeing strategic research on all the priority areas of the Foundation including, for instance: transforming health care using information and technology, re-engineering government to respond to new national security threats, improving people’s lives in developing countries by connecting them to information networks, developing multi-stakeholder networks to tackle global governance challenges, changing education through information technology et al. Many of Markle’s reports have been translated into legislation and executive orders, and have informed the creation of new organizations and businesses. He is also an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Culture and Communications at New York University, Senior Research Fellow for the Center for Media and Communications Studies at Central European University in Budapest; and an Affiliated Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Global Communications Studies at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communications.

He is still an emeritus fellow at Oxford. He also taught several years at the London School of Economics. Verhulst was the UNESCO Chairholder in Communications Law and Policy for the UK, a former lecturer on Communications Law and Policy issues in Belgium, and Founder and Co-Director of the International Media and Info-Comms Policy and Law Studies at the University of Glasgow School of Law. He has served as a consultant to numerous international and national organizations, including the Council of Europe, the European Commission, UNESCO, World Bank, UNDP, USAID, the UK Department for International Development among others. He has been a grant recipient of the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Markle Foundation. Verhulst has authored and co-authored several books, including: In Search of the Self: Conceptual Approaches to Internet Self Regulation (Routledge, 2001); Convergence in European Communications Regulation (Blackstone, 1999); EC Media Law and Policy (AWL, 1998); Legal Responses to the Changing Media (OUP, 1998); and Broadcasting Reform in India (OUP, 1998).
