		<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p>For many low-income citizens, getting access to benefits for which they are already eligible requires a minefield of forms, websites and duplicate documentation. Technology can improve government and organizational efficiency and ensure that thousands of citizens don’t lose out on benefits simply by enabling the automation of enrollment and renewal of people into the system. Recertifications can be automatic rather an arduous and instead of repetitive paperwork, people can get what they need and the government can reduce administrative costs. Innovations in Automatic Benefits for Citizens is a ten week (every other week) online coaching program designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs (both individuals and teams) who are developing projects around the automation and delivery of benefits and services for citizens. With expert guidance from Councilmember Ben Kallos, Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations of the New York City Council, we will help you to understand the operational flow of government as well as how to start building free and open source tools and/or bridge them with resources like OpenFisca and CiviCRM. Whether your project is nonprofit or for-profit, this program aims through peer-to-peer support and expert coaching and mentoring to help innovators design, implement, scale, and assess effective projects.</p>

              <h4>Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations of the City Council</h4>
              <p>At the beginning of his career in public service, Ben Kallos put Albany voting records online so New Yorkers could hold politicians accountable. Since then, he has run a government reform organization that helped defeat a corrupt politician and has served as Policy Director for former Public Advocate Mark Green. Council Member Kallos serves as Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations of the City Council, where he has fought to bring reform and transparency to government agencies. Praised by the New York Times for his "fresh ideas," Council Member Kallos has advocated for improving our schools, senior services and transportation. Council Member Kallos graduated from Bronx Science, SUNY Albany and SUNY Buffalo Law School. He has a background in law, working as a union-side labor attorney, as well as technology and government, and has served as a member of Community Board 8 and Statewide Committee Chair for the New York Democratic Lawyers Council. He and his wife reside on the East Side, where he has lived his entire life.</p>
